		<p>Organized in 1985, the Hall of Fame was a dream of longtime Muskegon Chronicle sportswriter Dick Hedges. As  president, Hedges assembled a board of directors and the group went about the task of organizing the new entity. Geographic boundaries, spanning from Ludington to the north and Grand Haven to the south, were established and funding to start the Hall was raised.</p>

	    <p>A home to display memorabilia was found at the Muskegon County Museum. The group solicited the community to suggest candidates for the hall of fame and the first group of honorees were chosen in September of 1986.</p>

	    <p>After 11 years and two different physical locations at the museum, the Hall of Fame made plans to move to the renovated L.C. Walker Arena in 1997. New showcases and displays were designed to house the organization's growing collection of artifacts and memorabilia.</p>
